# Prashanth Reddy Dandyala
I am an Astrophile, Someone who is fond of Astronomy and really mad at gazing the dark sky for finding the truths of the Universe, on Motto called *SOMEWHERE SOMETHING INCREDIBLE IS WAITING TO BE KNOWN* . Apart from this I am curious personality always love to learn something new and always want to do something new and unique.
